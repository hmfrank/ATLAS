# Advanced Tool for Log Analytics and Statistics - A.T.L.A.S.
This is a tool for analyzing apache log files and generating statistics. There is no working release yet, so don't use
this tool for now.

# Building ATLAS
To build ATLAS simply run `./make.py`, which will automatically generate a makefile, run `make` and execute the program.

If you're wondering what the CMakeLists.txt is for: I just need that so CLion works properly but I don't really know
how CMake works so I'm using the Python script. If you know CMake, you can use that, too.

_Version_ 0.0.0.1
